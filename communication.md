Communication is an obviously critical part of a team and how everyone works together. Getting the right communication style can be difficult in the most ideal of scenarios; it can be even tougher when a majority of the office is remote. Below are some general thoughts on how to effectively communicate with the Team.

## Meetings
Here's the thing. In a real life office, you can slide your chair over to someone's desk to ask a question. This is both a pro and a con. The pro is that communication face-to-face is more natural than via a keyboard.

The con is that it doesn't always respect people's time, bandwidth, and focus. Just barging into their space while they're working disrupts their flow by an average of 15 minutes (I've read that somewhere, I swear)

So it's with this being said, we will have more structure around meetings.  

#### Ad hoc
If you have a "how" or "why" question for someone, hop onto skype and do a meeting. The rule here is it has to be a video meeting. No voice only meetings.

#### Monday Meetings
Every monday we'll kick off with a staff meeting where we set the objectives for the week. In this meeting prepare to discuss what you're going to accomplish and what may be blocking you. Make sure the [Standard Code Masterlist](https://www.standardco.de/projects) is up to date!

#### Friday Meetings
On Fridays we have more of an announcement / cool stuff going on / biz development / look at all these cool stats! type of meeting. 

## Tools (things to facilitate communication)

**Slack** -- it ain't no surprise that we're huge fans. Keep doing what you're doing.

**Video Chat** -- as of the writing of this page (01/23/2018) we have moved over to http://appear.in for video chat. The concept is cool; everyone has their own “room” where people can enter or knock (if you lock the room) to visit. If you need to have a meeting, do it via appear.in. The free version allows up to 4 participants per room. We have a paid room at http://appear.in/standardcode that allows up to 12 people. 

**Masterlist** -- an internal tool we use in lieu of a standup meeting. Add projects / tasks to the list and update everyday before you go home. In the mornings [Gerald](https://www.standardco.de/gerald) will send a slack message to the #daily_updates channel with everyone's update
