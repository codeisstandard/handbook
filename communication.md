Communication is an obviously critical part of a team and how everyone works together. Getting the right communication style can be difficult in the most ideal of scenarios; it can be even tougher when a majority of the office is remote. Below are some general thoughts on how to effectively communicate with the Team.

## Meetings
Here's the thing. In a real life office, you can slide your chair over to someone's desk to ask a question. This is both a pro and a con. The pro is that communication face-to-face is more natural than via a keyboard.

The con is that it doesn't always respect people's time, bandwidth, and focus. Just barging into their space while they're working disrupts their flow by an average of 15 minutes (I've read that somewhere, I swear)

So it's with this being said, we will have more structure around meetings.  

#### Ad hoc
If you have a "how" or "why" question for someone, hop onto skype and do a meeting. The rule here is it has to be a video meeting. No voice only meetings.

#### Monday Meetings

#### Friday Meetings

## Tools (things to facilitate communication)

**Slack** -- it ain't no surprise that we're huge fans. Keep doing what you're doing.

**Video Chat** -- as of the writingof this page (12/21/2017) we're going to keep using Skype as the video chat of choice. However, there are a few other tools we're experimenting with. More to come!

**Arrived In** -- still looking at this but it's a tool that simulates have a "room" or "office" that people can knock on
