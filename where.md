# Where We Work

We're proudly headquartered in [Atlanta, GA](community.md). Our office is located at [Switchyards](https://scontent-sea1-1.cdninstagram.com/t51.2885-15/e35/16230994_168419240309893_5370344497517428736_n.jpg) in downtown. However, we have team members in the following places:

* Atlanta, GA (obviously)
* Albany, GA
* Davao City, Philippines
* Nairobi, Kenya
* Lusaka, Zambia
* In a van down by the river, USA ([seriously, check it out](https://www.instagram.com/burningvan/))

So yeah, you can see that we're spread around.

## Work from home

This is easy: get your stuff done and work from home whenever you need to. Generally speaking we like to see people more often than not but hey, we're pretty easy going folks. If you're going to work from home, drop a note in the #general channel on slack

*one exception -- we ask that participants in the apprentice program be in the office during normal business hours. Learning to develop is tricky enough but it's even harder if you're trying to do it alone.*

## Travel

2017 was the first year we actively pushed non-partners to travel. We believe strongly that our team should get to see the where the software they're building is in use. It's a form of the Lean Startup "get out of the building" credo. So, while we can't promise that we'll do it each year, we're striving to give the team more of an opportunity to travel.
