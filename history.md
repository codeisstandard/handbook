# History
Standard Code was started in 2013 because we kept running out of money on our other company, [We&Co](http://www.weand.co) (what's the point of a handbook if we're not going to be honest). We'd raised a seed round of money from ATL and NY investors and while they were wonderful to us, the reality is we were tired of asking them for money. So we took matters into our own hands.

[Jared](https://www.standardco.de/jared-malan-partner-experience) and [TJ](https://www.standardco.de/tj-muehleman-partner-relationships), a designer and developer respectively, took on a few projects. The money they made was immediately put back into their original startup We&Co. This went on for a month or two until they realized they were missing a critical skill: mobile developer. They'd shared an office with [Jonathan Nesbitt](https://www.standardco.de/jonathan-nesbitt-partner-technology) back when they all worked out of the Goat Farm and knew he was a good guy. They asked him to join as the third co-founder and voila, the Standard Code team was born!

The newly formed company continued to poor resources and time into ol We&Co for a few years after their formation. However, around the 2 year mark the team was introduced to some folks in the Global Health community and asked to help build a mobile data collection tool. A tool that could work anywhere in the world, on cheap commodity devices, and store the data in the cloud. The tool that emerged, LINKS, has now been used in over 50 countries on hundreds of research projects! It was this project that paved the way for team Standard Code to grow into a company almost entirely dedicated to building tools for the global health world.

Even though Standard Code started as a services company, building a product was something that was always core to who we were. More on that in the [product](product.md) section.
