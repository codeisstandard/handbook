# Apprentice
One thing we believe in very strongly (besides stocking really good beef jerky in the office) is helping to educate the next generation of coders. To do that, we created an apprentice program. As of this writing (June 2017), we've helped put over 10 people through the apprentice program, all of whom are still working as professional developers somewhere (mostly with us thankfully). Our apprentice program works like this:

**Pay**

Apprentices work for us for 3-6 months....and they get **paid** (unpaid internships are lame). We believe quality of live go hand-in-hand when learning a new trade. And if you can't pay your bills, your quality of life is gonna suck.

**Work**

They do real work. No menial bullshit tasks. We spread the workload across a variety of disciplines during the apprenticeship. We typically start with front end -- learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Javascript. You'll work with the eminent front end technologist, Jared Malan (co-founder and partner).

After the front end segment, you'll move on to backend. We're a ruby on rails shop so we'll focus on routing, controllers, models, authentication, basic rails commands, etc.

Lastly, we'll spend time with Git, Heroku (our hosting platform of choice), AWS (where we do all kinds of weird server kinda things), and databases.

All of this will be done on real client projects. Learning to code as a professional on internal / non real life projects has a way of not really teaching much of anything -- it teaches you to tinker, which is great and a quality we value! But building production product is more than tinkering. It's engineering. That's what we're teaching.

**Give Back**

During the program we ask our team to do two things:
1. Give a lunch-n-learn on a topic they've learned about. We have the attitude that even the most senior people in our organization can learn from the most junior. In fact, it's one way the old fogies at Standard Code keep up on what's new -- the newer developers have a thirst for learning that 20 year veterans sometimes forget.

2. We also encourage giving back in some form or function -- whether it be contributing to open source software, answering Stack Overflow articles, or contributing content to our website.

**Application Process**

Nothing we do at Standard Code is "business as usual". That includes our process for folks applying for our apprentice program. We don't believe in whiteboard sessions or technical reviews. Those are bullshit. The best way to determine if someone is a good fit is to have them solve real world problems. So we created this site: [Apprentice Application](http://standardco.de/apprentice). It's kind of a scavenger hunt to test basic problem solving skills. Parts of it are purposefully vague. We do this to test whether someone is willing to stop and ask for help (or ask questions).

After the scavenger hunt we have a sit down to understand what drives someone. Are they a good culture fit? Do we like being around them? Are they intensely curious?
