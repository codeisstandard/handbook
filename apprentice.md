# Apprentice
One thing we believe in very strongly (besides stocking really good beef jerky in the office) is helping to educate the next generation of coders. To do that, we created an apprentice program. As of this writing (June 2017), we've helped put over 10 people through the apprentice program, all of whom are still working as professional developers somewhere. Our apprentice program works like this:

1. Apprentices work for us for 3-6 months....and they get **paid** (unpaid internships are lame)
2. They do real work. No menial bullshit tasks
