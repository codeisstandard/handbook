## Why ATL?

Atlanta is a fantastic place to start a company. The cost of living is perfect, the "just get it done" mentality works well with us, and the diversity of people in this city is just about unparalleled. And since our primary focus is on healthcare technology (specifically global healthcare tech) there are few cities better suited for us. CDC, Task Force for Global Health, The Carter Center, and Emory University are all within 5 miles of us (and they're all clients!).

## Community

We support a variety of groups, organizations, non profits, etc either by giving up our time or giving up some of our cash. Here's who we love in ATL:

* [Rails Girls ATL](https://opencollective.com/railsgirlsatl)
* [Project Healing Waters](http://www.projecthealingwaters.org/)
* [Kirkwood Business Association](http://www.kirkwoodbiz.com/)
* [Tech Talent South](http://www.techtalentsouth.com)

## Switchyards

We're based in downtown Atlanta at the [Switchyards Downtown Club](http://www.switchyards.com), an office specifically set up for the B2C community. If you're asking "what are you fools doing there? you do public health?" you'd be asking a great question! We believe very strongly that while we are not a consumer company, we think and act like a consumer company. That is, we really genuinely care about user experience. We want people to use our platforms and think "damn, this just works". That ethos and mindset really works for us.

And if nothing else, we have a really rad office in the basement with our own patio!
