# Philosophy and Core Values

At our most basic, these three things make us tick:

## Stay product focused
We love getting hired to build random shit for people. Really, we do! And we love customizing things to meet people's needs. Honestly, that's super cool! But what we love more than anything is making a product, finding ways to make it better, and finding people who **need** it. When we started Standard Code, we knew we wanted to build our own digital products. We also knew that raising money for an idea is something we didn't want to do again. So we funded the R&D on these projects by doing services work.

Over the last 4 years, we've experimented with a few dozen ideas, built 10+ MVPs, made revenue on a 3 or 4 different projects, and formally launched a real product in 2016 called [Secure Data Kit](http://www.securedatakit.com), a healthcare data platform primarily used by global health organizations.

## Stay humble
Software developers are the great beneficiaries of a staggering supply / demand problem. That is, there ain't enough developers to fill all the jobs out there. So jobs are plentiful, pay is good, etc. This leads to a lot of inflated egos. And inflated egos tend to think they know the answer. Our belief is **we don't have all the answers**. We talk to our clients and users and customers and colleagues and partners to understand what the needs are and we construct the answers based on their needs. This means we try and go into every meeting with an open mind. We apply this philosophy to clients and team members -- we assume noething about the people we bring onto the team (read more in our [apprentice](apprentice.md) section).

## Stay curious
It's kind of a given that you have to stay curious in the software world. Technology changes as fast as industry -- if you want to stay relevant, you have to stay curious. How do we activate that curiosity though?

**20% time**
We borrowed an old concept from Google. We give everyone on our team, from partners on down, 20% of their time to work on whatever they want. However, implementing this has been easier said than done. We're on our 3rd iteration of 20% time -- the jury is still out if it will work but so far the signs are promising. Here are the iterations we've gone through:

1. **Work on whatever the hell you want:** We thought "who wouldn't want to do this??" turns out that not everyone wants total latitude to work on what they wanted. Granted, the [Database of Nachos](http://www.databaseofnachos.com) was born in this way but our team largely ignored 20% time and did regular work (note: you know you have a solid team when they say "i'll do real work rather than do whatever I want")
2. **Work on whatever you want (with a little nudge from us):** Completely open ended 20% time was kind of a failure. We found that half the team liked the latitude while the other half wanted more direction. So for those that wanted it we kinda nudged them in a direction by giving them more guidance. But it was still pretty unstructured...
3. **Work on something that makes our product(s) better:** As of the writing of this document (June 2017) we're partway through our 3rd iteration of the 20% time. Now we sit with the team and say "what do you want to learn". We heard things like machine learning, data visualization, better onboarding experience for clients using Secure Data Kit, etc. So, working in conjunction with each teammember, we crafted very specific projects with very specific deliverables. We'll know more in a few weeks at the end of Q2 how it worked. Stay tuned!
