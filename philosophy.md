# Philosophy and Core Values

At our most basic, we believe in a few things:

## We are a product company
We love getting hired to build random shit for people. Really, we do! And we love customizing our products to meet people's needs. Honestly, that's super cool! But what we love more than anything is making a product and finding ways to make it better. Here's a glimpse into our methodology for building product:

## Always stay humble
Software developers are the great beneficiaries of a staggering supply / demand problem. That is, there ain't enough developers to fill all the jobs out there. So jobs are plentiful, pay is good, etc. This leads to a lot of inflated egos. And inflated egos tend to think they know the answer. Our belief is **we don't know the answers**. We talk to our clients and users and customers and colleagues and partners to understand what the needs are and we construct the answers on the fly depending on what we here. This means we try and go into every meeting with an open mind. Every person we interview we assume nothing based on their background (read more in our [apprentice](apprentice.md) section).

## Always stay curious
It's kind of a given that you have to stay curious in the software world. Technology changes as fast as industry -- if you want to stay relevant, you have to stay curious. How do we activate that curiosity though?

**20% time**
We borrowed an old concept from Google. We give everyone on our team, from partners on down, 20% of their time to work on whatever they want. However, implementing this has been easier said than done. We're on our 3rd iteration of 20% time -- the jury is still out if it will work but so far the signs are promising. Here are the iterations we've gone through:

1. **Work on whatever the hell you want:** We thought "who wouldn't want to do this??" turns out that not everyone wants total latitude to work on what they wanted. Granted, the [Database of Nachos](http://www.databaseofnachos.com) was born in this way but our team largely ignored 20% time and did regular work (note: you know you have a solid team when they say "i'll do real work rather than do whatever I want")
2. **Work on whatever you want (with a little nudge from us):**
3. **Work on something that makes our product(s) better:**
