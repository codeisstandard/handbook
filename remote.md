Effective in 2018, Standard Code / Secure Data Kit will be implementing a remote work policy. At it's core, our remote work policy is this:

> Get your work done and work when you want, where you want

Pretty simple, right? Naturally to help folks embrace the awesomeness that is remote work we've decided to write down some guiding principles around this

## Respect People's Timezone
It's important that people in far away places feel like they are home wherever they are. That said, if it's 3pm where you are, remind yourself that it may not be 3pm where the person you're working with is. If you send them a message and it's after "normal" working hours, don't be surprised if you don't get a response immediately.

That said, we've created an escalation procedure in case you need someone immediately. Find that [here](escalation.md).

## Over communicate
Ok so communication is one of the hardest things to get right about remote work. So much so in fact that we created a special page dedicated to it. Read more about how we communicate [here](communication.md).

## Home office
Atlanta is our home and will remain so. We will keep our hub out of Switchyards in downtown Atlanta. 

## Yearly summit
Nothing replaces face-to-face communication so once a year we will meet up somewhere. Have fun. Talk about Standard Code stuff.
