# Holidays and Vacation and Taking Time Off and Chilling Out

Working for a software company is a taxing, brain draining enterprise. So you need time off, ya know?

## Vacation
We believe in unlimited time off which basically means take off what you need to. Our philosophy is get done what you need to get done and the rest will take care of itself.

## Holidays (2018)
* MLK – January 15th
* Memorial Day – May 28th
* Independence Day – July 4th - 6th
* Labor Day – September 3rd
* Thanksgiving – November 22nd - 23rd
* Christmas – New Years – December 24th – January 1st

## Sick Days
Don't feel good? Stay home.

Got a sick child? Stay home.

Got a sick dog? Stay home (but you can probably get some work done remotely, right?)
