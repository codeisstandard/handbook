# Product

(note: this page is not finished)

Our product philosophy comes from years of working for and starting our own startups. Our guiding principle is this:

    >  Go that way really fast. If something gets in your way....turn.

If that sounds vaguely familiar, it's because it's a line from one of the greatest movies of all time, [Better Off Dead](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEHZJNQ5Y4A). And while it is just a goofy movie quote, it does capture how we approach building Startups. You have to do it with speed. And when something doesn't go right (which will inevitably happen) be prepared to course correct.

We follow a pretty simple model when vetting product ideas. It goes something like this:

## Idea --> Project --> MVP --> Startup

Where:

**Idea**

This is pretty obvious. We all have grand ideas. "This thing is going to change the way we interact with designers!" "We have a new social network for cat enthusiasts!". Problem is, getting from idea to something actionable is a major suckfest. We actually created an app called [Ideashaper](https://www.standardco.de/ideashaper-get-your-ideas-in-front-of-your-team) to help us take ideas to turn them into more thoroughly vetted ideas -- something that could turn into a project.

Examples:

**Project**

Examples:
**MVP**

One very simple idea we abide by when we roll out an MVP: can this thing generate $1,000 in revenue? If so, how quickly can we do it? We've rolled out MVPs that were generating revenue but would have taken 2 years to get to $1,000 in revenue (this is not an original idea; we stole it from [this guy](http://tinyletter.com/orbital/letters/our-next-program-the-orbital-1k)). What we found is that by being focused on a very small, attainable goal, we were able to more quickly vet ideas. Our average time on an MVP was around 30 days. Now you might make a compelling argument

Examples: Dear Faye, Meet Leon
**Startup**

Hey this is a company! With revenues and customers and employees and problems and headaches and product market fit problems. But it's real. And that's what we've managed to create with [Secure Data Kit](http://www.securedatakit.com), our global health data platform.

**Sidenote: Fun Projects are ok too**

Sometimes we build crazy, non sensical things to help us maintain our sanity. We built the Database of Nachos for this reason. Actually, it did have a real purpose for being: we needed to learn how to store geographical data in postgresql and then how to do a bounds search ("find all restaurants that serve nachos between these latitudes and longitudes")
