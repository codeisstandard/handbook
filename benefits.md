# Benefits

We're a small company but we believe that even small companies should take care of their team. Every year we've been in business we've added one substantial benefit.

## Medical Insurance

We provide health insurance for employees and dependents. Depending on the plan that is selected, we cover anywhere from 80 - 100% of the premium.

## Retirement Plan

We do matching! Up to 3%.

## Technology Stipend (or donation to charity)

We provide a yearly stipend of up to $250 for technology purchases. The most popular purchase thus far has been Raspberry Pis and assorted parts. However, if you don't feel the spend money on tech goods, you can donate up to $250 of your money to a charity or non profit of your choice.

## Books and other stuff
