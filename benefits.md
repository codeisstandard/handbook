# Benefits

We're a small company but we believe that even small companies should take care of their team. Every year we've been in business we've added one substantial benefit.

## Medical Insurance

We provide health insurance for employees and dependents. Depending on the plan that is selected, we cover anywhere from 80 - 100% of the premium.

## Retirement Plan

We do matching! Up to 3%.

## Technology Stipend (or donation to charity)

We provide a yearly stipend of up to $250 for technology purchases. The most popular purchase thus far has been Raspberry Pis and assorted parts. However, if you don't feel the spend money on tech goods, you can donate up to $250 of your money to a charity or non profit of your choice.

## Books and other stuff

Need a book? We have a VAST library of material to draw from (ok, not true but we do have a decent stack of nerd books). If it's not in the library, we'll pick it up. We also won't hesitate to get the best equipment we can for our team. That said, we're scrappy and made our desks. But we did buy some nice chairs and monitors!
