# Random Stuff

Here's a random collection of things we do at Standard Code. You could call these our traditions:

## When we make big sales

We don't have a gong. Or a fancy ass bell that gets rung. We don't have a company fancy car that people get to drive (though getting a company bike is a good idea. Hmmmm....). Nope. When we close a big deal, we do two things:

1. We buy some kind of office decor. We have an...eclectic...collection ([think grandma's basement](http://s3.amazonaws.com/sc-apprenticer/images/images/000/000/390/original/IMG_3883.JPG?1498162419)). So we're constantly adding to it.

2. Happy hour! Ok this part might be cliche -- but who doesn't like a good beer?!? We've rented out a brewery and a vintage game bar in the past.

## We keep the fridge well stocked

With food that is...ok, beer too...but we have breakfast / lunch / snack items in the fridge at all times. Are we missing something you want? Just ask.

## Friday Team lunch

Every friday we convene team lunch. Usually we head out somewhere downtown but hey, sometimes you just need a good bowl of ramen and off to Buford Highway we go. Since we've grown in size, getting all of us out may not be practical. That's when we fire up the patio grill and get our burger (or dog...or black bean burger) on.

## Get outta the office

Once a month we *try* to get out of the building and do something totally unrelated to technology. We've done a blacksmithing class, gone to the park to throw the frisbee, habitat builds, etc. A few summers ago we had a "Plant Draft" where we wanted to see who could do the best job growing an indoor plant.

Coming up we have an excursion to learn how to climb trees and we're planning a visit to the CDC Museum.

## One year anniversary!

Work with us for a year and you get your very own pair of Bose noise canceling headphones (unless you want $300 worth of textbooks -- we've done that too)

## This is an Easter Egg

Reading this and wondering what an easter egg is? Send an email to info@standardco.de with the subject "I love Gerald!" and we'll send you a cool present!

## Dress code

We don't have one.

## Gerald

Gerald is a mythical employee of Standard Code. One day in 2017 we just started referring to any random male as "Gerald" (e.g "looks like Gerald logged into the site again and messed up a form"). It sort of took on a life of it's own. We now have a portrait of him in the office and we even named a Slack bot after him. We love him.
